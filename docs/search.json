The most common length of a bus stop name (which is usually formatted like “Paramount / Slauson”) is around 17 characters. Very few bus stops have less than 10 characters in them.\nThis is a table of the 10 streets with the most bus stops on them:\n\n\nShow the code\n#Count how many stops there are on each street\nCommon_streets1 &lt;- LA_bus_stops |&gt;\n  group_by(stop_street_1)|&gt;\n  summarize(count1 = n())|&gt;\n  rename(stop_street = stop_street_1)\n\nCommon_streets2 &lt;- LA_bus_stops |&gt;\n  group_by(stop_street_2)|&gt;\n  summarize(count2 = n())|&gt;\n  rename(stop_street = stop_street_2)\n\nCommon_streets &lt;- \n  full_join(Common_streets1, Common_streets2, by = \"stop_street\")|&gt;\n  mutate(total_count = (count1 + count2))|&gt;\n  select(stop_street, total_count)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_count))|&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(stop_street))\n  \nprint(head(Common_streets,10))\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   stop_street total_count\n   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Vermont             255\n 2 Sunset              244\n 3 Broadway            232\n 4 Figueroa            224\n 5 Western             209\n 6 Victory             203\n 7 Olympic             201\n 8 Slauson             200\n 9 Imperial            192\n10 Rosecrans           186\n\n\nThis table was made by separating the bus stops’ names (which are usually formatted like “Paramount / Slauson”) into the first street (Paramount) and the second street (Slauson). The first street in this naming convention is the street that the bus runs on, and the second street is the cross street. After separating and counting the number of times each street is mentioned, I added the number of times the first street (Paramount in this example) is mentioned to the times it is mentioned as a cross street to get the number of bus stops that are on the street or stop at it as a cross street. stop_street tells you the street and total_count tells you the number of bus stops on or at that street.\nThis is a table of the 10 numbered streets with the most bus stops on them:\n\n\nShow the code\n#Which are the numbered streets with the most bus stops on them?\nCommon_streets|&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(stop_street, \"\\\\d.*\"))|&gt;\n  head(10)\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   stop_street total_count\n   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;\n 1 3rd                 131\n 2 7th                 118\n 3 6th                 110\n 4 8th                 104\n 5 1st                  99\n 6 4th                  54\n 7 5th                  46\n 8 9th                  32\n 9 23rd                 30\n10 120th                28\n\n\nThis table was created in the same way as the table above and then filtered to only count the numbered streets.\nThis analysis comes from publicly-available GTFS data provided by LA Metro.\n\nData Source: https://gitlab.com/LACMTA/gtfs_bus/-/tree/weekly-updated-service\nData Authors: https://developer.metro.net/gtfs-schedule-data/"

    "text": "This project is inspired by a walk I took on last Saturday night. That night, I chose to walk around the 5Cs for around 3 hours, and I ran into around 8 of my close friends and had a lot of fun. As I walked, I ran into different sized groups of people, sometimes I would pass no one and sometimes I would pass huge groups of people.\nI chose to model the group sizes using an exponentially distributed set of random numbers with a rate of 0.25 since I approximate that I would run into an average of 4 people per minute.\n\n\nShow the code\n#sample plot of the distributions of the number of people I would see each minute over 3 hours\nset.seed(14)\nexprate &lt;- 0.25\nrandom_exponent &lt;- data.frame(n = map_dbl(1:180, function(x){\n    floor(rexp(1, exprate))}))\nggplot(random_exponent, aes(x = n))+\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)+\n  labs(\n    x = \"Number of people seen each minute\",\n    title = \"Sample distribution of the number of people seen each minute for \\n180 minutes\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows how many times I see a certain amount of people each minute if I walk around for 180 minutes. It shows that in this case, I would most commonly see 0 people per minute during my walk, followed by 1 people per minute, then 2 people per minute.\nEach person in each group of people I pass gets assigned a random number which indicates their closeness to me. I say that I am equally likely to see anyone from my closest friend (1) to my least close friend at the 5Cs (6000). For example, if I passed 2 people in the same minute (the randomly generated exponentially distributed number from before), my 5th closest friend and my 16th closest friend, that minute would be given the vector (5, 16). Then, I take the random numbers that have been generated for each minute and put them into one long vector, basically the vector of people I have seen throughout the entire night.\n\n\nShow the code\n#pass random people walking around the 5Cs\nstart_walking_for &lt;- function(number_of_minutes, how_close){\n  people_passed &lt;- map_dbl(1:number_of_minutes, function(x){\n    round(rexp(1, exprate))}) #vector of the number of people I pass every minute\n  list_of_people &lt;- map(people_passed, function(x){round(runif(x, min = 1, max = 6000))})\n  vector_of_people &lt;- unlist(list_of_people) #Time steps do not matter, so it doesn't matter if I see someone in minute 1 or minute 156.\n  sum(vector_of_people &lt;= how_close) #How many times do I see someone who is my close friend?\n}\n\n\nTo count the number of times I see my close friends, I have to set a cutoff for what counts as a close friend and what counts as a not-so-close friend. I arbitrarily picked that number as 15, since I feel like there are about 15 people in the 5Cs who I would stop and have a conversation with in the middle of the night if I saw them.\nI ran this simulation for 5000 nights to see what the average number of friends I would see per 180-minute night would be.\n\n\nShow the code\nwalking_time &lt;- 180\nfriends &lt;- 15\nnights &lt;- 5000  \n\nsimulation &lt;- data.frame(friends_seen = map_dbl(1:nights, ~start_walking_for(walking_time, friends)))\n\nggplot(simulation) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = friends_seen), binwidth = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How many times do I see a certain amount of friends in one night?\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"Total nights = \", nights),\n    x = \"Number of friends seen\",\n    y = \"Number of nights walking around\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that it is very unlikely to have a night like my Saturday night where I saw 8 of my close friends. This means that either I am more likely to see my friends than non-friends (which is true since I knew where they generally were that night and used Find My once to find a friend), that I saw more people on my walk than I estimated, or that I am closer with more people than I estimated.\nThe plot also shows that I am most likely to see one friend on a given 3-hour walk, but for about 900 of my 5000 simulated walks, I see no friends.\nTo simulate my random night walks around the 5Cs, I generated randomly sized groups of people that I saw every minute that usually ranged from 0 to around 18 people. Then, I gave each person in that group a random “closeness score” to me, which indicated how well I knew them. Then, I counted how many times I ran into people that were a certain degree of closeness to me, and ran that simulation many times to determine what the most likely outcome of a night of randomly walking around the 5C campus was (in places where other people also go).\nOne way that this model could be improved is to account for my arrival to points of interest where many people congregate at once like Jay’s Place, the Hub, or parties. Another way that this simulation could be improved is to account for the fact that most of my friends are friends with each other, so they are more likely to be traveling in a group together than dispersed among many groups of people."
