## Background Information

- My favorite thing to do on weekend nights this semester has been walking around and seeing people.
- The Saturday night before this project was due I had a really fun night where I ran into at least 8 of my close friends.
- My question: "What is the probability that I run into 'X' number of friends on a given night of walking around the 5Cs?"


## General Overview

- I walk for 3 hours (180 minutes).
- I pass a certain number of people every minute.
- Each of those people lie somewhere on the scale between my closest friend at the 5Cs and the most complete stranger I could come across at the 5Cs.

## How I Created the Model

- I created a distribution of the number of people I pass each minute.
- The rate for this distribution is 1/4, which means I would see an average of 4 people each minute.

```{r}
set.seed(14)
exprate <- 0.25
data.frame(n = map_dbl(1:180, function(x){
    floor(rexp(1, exprate))})) 
```

## How I Created the Model

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "This plot shows how many times I see a certain number of people each minute if I walk around for 180 minutes."
sample_distribution
```



## How I Created the Model

- Who is in these groups of people that I pass each minute?
- Assign each person in each group a number between 1 and 6000.
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|3-5|6-7|11-12|"
#pass random people walking around the 5Cs
start_walking_for <- function(number_of_minutes, how_close){
  people_passed <- map_dbl(1:number_of_minutes, function(x){
    floor(rexp(1, exprate))}) 
      #vector of the number of people I pass every minute
  list_of_people <- map(people_passed, function(x){
    round(runif(x, min = 1, max = 6000))})
  vector_of_people <- unlist(list_of_people) 
    #Time steps do not matter, 
    #so it doesn't matter if I see someone in minute 1 or minute 156.
  sum(vector_of_people <= how_close) 
    #How many times do I see someone who is my close friend?
}
```

## Results
- Run this simulation 5000 times to see the likelihood I run into 8 of my friends is.

```{r}
walking_time <- 180
friends <- 15
nights <- 5000  

data.frame(friends_seen = 
             map_dbl(1:nights, ~start_walking_for(walking_time, friends)))
```

## Results
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "This plot shows that it is very unlikely to have a night like my Saturday night where I saw 8 of my close friends."
final_results
```

## Interpreting Results
:::{.incremental}
- Why could this be?
- I have more friends than I estimated.
- I passed more people that night than I estimated.
- I am not actually passing random people.
